# Pactum Engineering

### What we do

We build the technology for autonomous negotiations for some of the world's largest companies -- in retail, manufacturing, logistics, and many other areas. Whenever something gets bought in a large company -- from SaaS to legal services to buckets of glue -- there is opportunity for negotiation. That's where Pactum steps in to reduce human work and find a deal that is better for both buyer and supplier.

Here are a few of the things our engineers say about what is cool at Pactum:

* "I think the way we build our negotiation is entire sci-fi movie"
* "Amazing engineers to work with and learn from & share knowledge to"
* "I like how bunch of our Typescript will decide who unloads one of largest trade fleets on planet."
* "How much money we saved our clients over the years, on autopilot."
* "Culture of [Architecture Decision Records](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/04/when-should-i-write-an-architecture-decision-record/)"
* "Negotiation science, improved and informed by data."
* "No-blame, learn from mistakes culture."

Don't get the impression it's all easy though. Some of the challenges we face:

* We are the first in the world building autonomous negotiations -- charting new territory. This means we sometimes don't know up-front what the product should be, and need to prototype fast with customers to figure this out.
* Enterprise customers expect us to conform to their process. Having a product that customizabile while keeping up speed and quality is a big challenge.
* Negotiations aren't a classical form of software: they are more akin to a building a computer game with complex structured conversation. Building that, fast, is hard.

AI at Pactum is not limited to one particular department; the whole product is about delivering an intelligent and automatic negotiation, so every product team is involved in building our AI. We were around before LLMs and will be around after: we are focusing on AI that creates value for our clients, not any particular technology.

How we strive to work:
* Frequent deliveries, learning quickly from quick iterations. We deploy hundreds of times per week.
* We take quality and maintainability seriously and invest into observability (centralized logging, distributed traces, alerting, metrics)
* We share knowledge, aim to avoid single person responsibility and mostly work in focused groups
* Teams have autonomy over their roadmaps, processes and ways of working

### FAQ
<details>
  <summary>Can I work remotely?</summary>

  We generally expect engineers to be able to come to our beautiful and centrally located Tallinn office a couple times a week, though we don't enforce a particular schedule and taking a few weeks per year to be entirely remote is acceptable.

<details>
  <summary>What's the interview process like?</summary>

  Our interview process for engineers generally consists of:

1. A 45-minute introduction interview with one of our engineering leaders.
2. A 1-hour coding interview, virtual.
3. A 2-hour system design interview, in-person.
4. A team interview where you'll meet your future team (some subset of engineering manager, product manager, and other team members)

After this, we make an offer.
